# Something to learn someday:

I just rediscovered the [Shavian writing system](https://shavian.info). I had seen it before, years ago, but forgot about it since. Recently, I stumbled upon it again. It reminds me a little bit of ancient Greek writing or the like. Each stroke can be done without ever lifting your pencil or pen off of the paper (no dots, no accents, etc...). And it's entirely phonetic. There are keyboards and fonts which you can use to write in it, it uses far less letters than the Roman alphabet in English, there are no double letters, and more. It seems like a great way to quickly write down notes.

I have other major things to worry about right now, but that definitely is going into my "Someday" projects list.
