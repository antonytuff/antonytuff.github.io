# Job sites suck

I know that this will be seen by recruiters, but I really don't give a damn. Job sites suck. Places like Glassdoor lead to a hundred different web sites, each wanting you to make a login for the job application. Each one is entirely fucking useless to me after I've posted and are just going to sit there in my neatly curated Passwords DB. They are literally trashing my machine with useless fucking shit that I don't need, or want, or will ever use again. Anyone who is looking for a job knows that this is a broken fucking system and somebody ought to fucking deal with this piece of shit. After making my 200+th login for the day, I'm done. I spend more time making logins than I actually do posting for the job. That tells you right there that it's broken as fuck, useless as fuck, and utter trash.

I'm a project manager and a site admin. I like it when things are neat, categorized, and in perfect order. Messing that up on my machine is fucking verboten.
