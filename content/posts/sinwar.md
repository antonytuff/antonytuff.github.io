# Sinwar and Rafah

Just a note: Sinwar was found and killed in Rafah - the same place that everyone told Israel not to go into. Clearly the Palestinians were putting up a humanitarian sob front as they always do, but it just goes to show that Israel shouldn't be listening to others when it comes to how to conduct their war against terrorist Nazi scumbags.
