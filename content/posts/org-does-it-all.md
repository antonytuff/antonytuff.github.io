# Org really does it all

Someone on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com "Hacker News") posted a link yesterday to a [productivity directory](https://productivity.directory "Productivity Directory") of apps for, of all things, productivity.

It's a nice enough website presenting apps such as Things, Evernote, Toggl, etc... Naturally, however, I'm (once again) hit by the realisation that [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org "Org Mode") (and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ "Emacs")) literally does all of this in one "package", so to speak. It's fairly impressive when you think about it, just how powerful it all is.
