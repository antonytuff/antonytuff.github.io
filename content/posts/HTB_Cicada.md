# Machine Overview

## üîç Information Gathering Phase
As usual, I started with information gathering to detect open ports and identify services running on the target server. I ran an Nmap scan to probe the system for vulnerabilities and service banners.
Based on the reseults of the Nmap , I noted the below key observations from Nmap:


###### Scanning through Nmap
- **53 (DNS):** Might be a domain controller. A prime target for domain enumeration.
- **88 (Kerberos):** Active Directory? Kerberos authentication service is active. This confirms the presence of Active Directory and potential ticket or AD related attacks.
- **135/445 (SMB):** File shares? We can dig out to see if there are any shares for any sensitive files or credentials.
- **389/636 (LDAP/LDAPS):** User/group hunting grounds.
- **5985 (WinRM):**  WinRM is enabled, opening up the possibility of remote command execution. if we have a valid username we can see if we can get a shell access.

```bash
masscan -e tun0 -p1-65535 10.10.11.35 --rate=1000
nmap -sV  -A  -sC --min-rate=1000s 10.10.11.35
```

Based on the results of the Nmap the below table maps out "Possible Attack Vectors" for gaining access to the machine.

###### RID Brute-Forcing ‚Äì Sniffing Out Domain User
Based on the results from Nmap‚Äôs  I decided to perform RID Brute-forcing using crackmapexec, aiming to enumerate user accounts on the Domain Controller (DC). This technique abuses the Relative Identifier (RID) sequencing, allowing us to query Security Identifiers (SIDs) and resolve them into usernames‚Äîoften without authentication.<br> The results are as follows:<br>

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.35  -u 'guest'  -p '' --rid-brute | tee domainusersv1.txt
```

![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020241231095940.png)


Hulla! We bagged a list of potential usernames. With this information , we can attempt AS-REP Roasting attack. This attack checks for accounts with pre-authentication disabled, letting us snag their hashed credentials for offline cracking.

**AS-REP Roasting Attempts as shown below**- (Nothing Found)
```
impacket-GetNPUsers cicada.htb/ -dc-ip 10.10.11.35 -usersfile domainusers.txt -no-pass -outputfile asrep_hashes.txt
```

![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020241231131133.png)

Even though this attempt didn‚Äôt yield a direct credential dump, the username list remains a valuable foothold for further att;acks. Next, We can explore another vector such enumerating services to identify potential misconfigurations. In my case we can check SMB;


## Enumeration
###### SMB Enumeration
Since port 445 (SMB) was open, we can check to see if there are any accessible SMB shares. In our cases the box had unahtenticated access which means of guest permissions are enabled we can be able to enumerate the shares in the drive.

Using SMB Client, I identified several interesting shares, as follows:
- **ADMIN$**: Remote Admin share (usually for administrative tasks).
- **C$**: Default administrative share for the C: drive.
- **DEV**: Custom share (possibly containing files).
- **HR**: Custom share (could be sensitive‚Äîrequires exploration).
- **IPC$**: Used for inter-process communication. 
- **NETLOGON**: Scripts for logging in domain accounts.
- **SYSVOL**: Policies and scripts for domain controllers

![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020241230225850.png)

What pooped out from the shares was  intereseting shares that seemed uniques:

```
- DEV: Custom share (possibly containing files).
- HR: Custom share (Contains a file named Notice from HR.txt).
```
###### üìÇ Extracting Credentials from HR Share
After accessing the HR Share, I found a file named **Notice from HR.txt**. Upon reviewing its contents, I discovered a message left for what seemed to be for a new hire which contained a password. 
Sounds like a promising lead,with this in hand, we can see if we can gain access initial foothold on the box or do authenticated scans on the SMB shares.
Alternatively, Since we have a a list of valid usernames from our RID Brute-forcing, we can attempt to perform password spraying on the box to see if we can get a hit.

![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020241230230616.png)

```
Password: Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8
```

From the password spray, I found that the user michael had a valid password match.With this we can perform authenticated scans,enabling deeper exploration of SMB shares,AD, and other network resources.
I alsoe attempted to evil-WinRM to the box, but in my case it didn't work out, may the domain user cannot authenticate to the host.The next logical steps I attempted was to enumerate the AD through the credetials

Leveraging the credentials,we can perform a quick users enumeration just to see if we can be able to enumerate AD objects, and by keenly on observing the results I spotted a verbose description for the user david  that had a pasword 
description. 

```
cicada.htb\david.orelious
aRt$Lp#7t*VQ!3
```

üé≠ VAPT Intel: This is a classic misconfiguration I‚Äôve encountered frequently in internal penetration tests. It‚Äôs common for system administrators to store credentials in user descriptions, especially when creating temporary or service accounts for easy reference. 
It's comes out handy in AD_Style engagements,some good starting point. 

Putting that aside, With David credentials, I attempted authenticated SMB enumeration to see what additional resources were accessible. I executed the below commands:

```
smbclient //10.10.11.35/DEV -U michael.wrighton
```
![](/img/Pasted%20image%2020241231114657.png)

I successfully accessed the DEV share and we are presented with a Backup_Script. Upon reviewing the script,there are hardcoded credentials belonging for the user emily.osacalrs.

```
emilyoscars
Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt
```

### Intial FootHold
Armed with Emily‚Äôs credentials, we can test for  WinRM authentication again‚Äîand this time, and boom we have a shell on the taget server.

Weh, le's first grab some coffee, and then we can come and look into Privilege escalation stufff...
