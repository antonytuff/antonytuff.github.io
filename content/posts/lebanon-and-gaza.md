# There isn't a solution right now

I haven't really written about this in donkey's years, but here goes:

If you want Israel to stop the war in Lebanon and in Gaza, all you have to do is get Hezzbollah and the Hamas to surrender.

The ball is in your court.

I might as well clarify a little bit: Almost all Israelis agree with this. Almost all Israelis are united in this. They aren't going to listen to warnings, or admonitions, or anything else of the kind apart from "We got Hezzbollah and Hamas to surrender". That's it. It doesn't matter how many refugees you put on camera, or "experts" you bring to discuss the issue. The world ignored Hezzbollah firing over 8000 times into Israel in one year, and now this is the result.
