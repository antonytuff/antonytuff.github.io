# I really like Dracula Theme for Emacs.

I've been trying the [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/emacs "Dracula Theme") for about a week or so and I really enjoy it. It's colourful and beautiful. It's going on my permanent rotation for dark themes. I rotate between light and dark ones (light in the morning, dark at night) every day but I only keep the ones which please me the best, so my list is rather small.

If you like a colourful theme every now and then, check this one out.
