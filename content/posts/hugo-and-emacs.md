# I’m installing two Emacs packages which help with Hugo sites.

I intend on publishing directly from Emacs without ever having to go to the CLI. Not that I don’t love the CLI - I do. I just want to be able to do everything directly from an Emacs interface. So far, i’m having a blast figuring this stuff out and reading the docs. Maybe there’s an IFTTT thing I can use to directly publish a link to Mastadon when I post. I have no idea but it’s something to check out.
