# I wonder how the QAnon idiots are justifying what's happened.

After all: Isn't Trump supposed to be the "real" President? If he was *really* in charge...why would the FBI raid his "inner sanctum"? Why would he have a warrant for a search?

What I'm really wondering is: How much information that counters their stupid, cretinous, "world view" does it take to snap them out of it? Will they ever actually snap out of it or will it just be a gradual process of moving on to the "next thing"?

What I'm *really* saying is that, in some instances, we did society an enormous disfavour by dismantling the Asylum system and outlawing lobotomies and electro-shock treatments.
