# Here's what we know

Since The [Atlantic Article is out on Trump and his thoughts about Hitler](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-military-generals-hitler/680327/ "The Atlantic"), here's a few things that we do know about America since 2016 up to and including today:

1) The Civil War of 1860 has never really ended.

2) There are a hell of a lot more deplorable fucking idiots out there than previously thought.

3) We now know that American Democracy is not especially immune to what happened in the 1930s in Germany.

If Trump grew a Hitler mustache, walked around with a swastika on his arm, and said his title was now "Der FÃ¼hrer", nearly half of registered voters would still be voting for him. Even if Harris wins, her administration is going to have to take an immediate and active role in dealing with this - unlike what the Biden administration did.
