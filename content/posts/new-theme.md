# New Theme - Blowfish

I've decided to change the theme to [blowfish](https://blowfish.page). It'll offer a lot more capabilities down the line, should I choose to use them.

I couldn't get [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) to properly update. I had made some changes which I never documented and it was either start over again to update, or choose something new. Fortunately, Hugo easily lets you switch themes. The long part is figuring out each individual configuration.

Next up: Exporting directly from [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org). That should be easy enough to translate into markdown directly and then rebuild from there.
