# Posted to Facebook:

It has recently been brought to my attention that I haven't really said anything on here in a very, very, very long time and just post polar bear pictures.

Very true. Well, there's a good reason for this, and I wrote about it before I stopped posting and responding: I don't trust Facebook and, worse, I would dismantle it if I could for what they have helped to do to our country, and many other countries around the world. In earnest, I think that people should stop using it. I really do.

I realize, however, that this is not going to happen. Most people use Facebook and don't know anything more technical than that. I realize, with sadness, that we're all pushing the wagon which will eventually run civilization off of a cliff - at least in the format that it exists today. And the same goes for Twitter and most social media.

I know, people think it's harmless fun, or the only way to keep in touch with their friends and family. But let me tell you something: If you're angry as hell about what has happened in the last seven years, then you should realize that it isn't harmless fun. It isn't just sharing photos. It's supporting a literal regime which is causing massive chaos throughout the world. And if you think I'm exaggerating, then you haven't learned anything about what is going on.

Look at how it entirely dominates every single sphere of our lives, and not in a good way. Even media companies that are tasked with criticizing Facebook have to literally *post on Facebook* to get their links noticed. Exactly how twisted is that? And nobody has even commented on this particular twist in any forum which I've yet to see. it's just accepted as normal. It isn't. It is absolutely sick and twisted for this to be the case.

Again: I realize I'm not going to change any minds because everyone is a fucking slave to this thing and rationalises it in their minds because they don't have time to do something differently, or don't want to break off contacts, or like having people notice their food they're eating - all while Facebook does social experiments on them which are destroying our democracies. Instead of not posting several pictures of their outing or comments on somebody else's food, they *could* take the time to learn how to do something differently. But they don't. They *could* go back to relying on RSS feeds for their news directly from the best sources and not buried in a sea of utter bullshit and nonsense which floods our screens every day.

I have so much more to say on that, but I know that it won't make a bloody difference. I also know that I might get some responses about how I'm exaggerating, in the exact same way people said I was exaggerating when I said that Trump would probably win, or when I said that Trump would probably foment a literal coup to stay in power. "You're exaggerating, it isn't that bad." I was told over and over again. When I said that Republicans were going to take away our rights with a Theocracy years before Trump finally did it, I was told that I was "exaggerating".

Do you want to make a bet how little I'm "exaggerating" over this?

You know, I get it: learning something about computers is difficult for most people. They just don't "get" technology. They want something simple and easy, even if it means they're trapping themselves forever. It's one reason I also no longer really use Gmail. I woke up and realized how literally almost every site identified me with my Gmail account and that it could be taken away at a moment's notice. Imagine suddenly not being able to get emails from your bank because Gmail decided to cancel your account because you pissed off the algorithm in some way. Most things that are marketed as "free" are generally not worth it. Sometimes they are, but you have to think about it long and hard beforehand.

If people would take the 3-10 hours in one day that they spend on Facebook and, instead, devote 1 hour each day to learning how to do things differently with computers, they would contribute to fixing this problem. They'd probably even enjoy the experience.

But they won't do it. They would rather have *all* of their friends notice what they say instead of just a few people who know where they are posting. After all, writing into the void isn't a very satisfying feeling for most people, and neither is posting a picture which no one will ever see. I get it. I do. So, suddenly, we've given Facebook the authority of being the forum for everything we do, say, see, taste, and experience in our lives. They've become the gatekeeprs of the public forum without ever being elected to that position of responsibility.

Well, not for me.

So, with that being said, I've started a blog again. It's at https://www.neurolog.dev where you can read more regular updates. I may even stop posting pictures here soon because, frankly, I just don't feel like doing it anymore. This is a bad place and I don't want to contribute to it. I'll keep posting this URL for a while and then you may not see me here anymore. It's not worth being here if I'm helping to contribute to the utter disaster which our societies have become. If you want to know how to read news in a better way than your fucking timeline, then take an hour of your time *off* of Facebook and look up what an RSS feed is. I've gone back to it a long while ago - I don't get bullshit news from Facebook timelines in years. It's better that way. And I couldn't care less that I'm missing the newest kitchen "hack" or other fake news idiocy that spreads on here in my timeline on a daily basis.

I've been posting polar bears here every single day for...8 years? Heck, I don't even really know and I don't care. The reason that I started doing it was because I wanted to see something first thing in the morning that at least made me somewhat happy. But seeing Facebook's interface every morning doesn't make me happy. It's a reminder of all of the above and more, and I should do away with it very soon.

And so should you.
