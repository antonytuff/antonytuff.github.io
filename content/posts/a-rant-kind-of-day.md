# It's a day to rant

It's a day for ranting. Either that, or completely ignoring what is about to happen in a few hours.
I've made it no secret as to my feelings on what I think about Trump, his supporters, and the electorate at large. I couldn't think of a worse situation to befall the United States and the rest of the world as what is about to take place.

The public at large are fucking idiots. That probably includes people you know whom are close to you. It sure does with me. But one thing I've done a long time ago is cut those people off - including family members who support this traitor and this virulent populism and idiotic nationalism. I have no regrets on that score whatsoever. What I do regret is their existence, and I regret that not only for myself, but for the world entire.

But that's not something I can do anything about, and neither can I do anything about what is going to happen in the next few years. I've leave the Cassandra-like predictions for another time, though I will say that for the last few years, I feel like Claudius witnessing the decline of the republic in his old age. 

"Let all the poisons that lurk in the mud hatch out."

What I am going to rant about, rather quickly, is Apple "Intelligence". I've had it for a while on my Mac, and it's pretty much useless. But it's not the GPT model which is inherently useless, because it has some uses which can be positive. Instead, for some reason, it's the UI.

You see, when you chat with GPT, you usually do it in a web page with saved scrollback and history. But not so with Apple "Intelligence". It's a clunky UI which has a semi-floating window, but there's no saved history - at least none which I can find. But if there is, it's not on by default. This makes long conversations completely useless. You'd think that a company which is known for their ease of use and handy UI designs would have got this basic functionality correct, but they didn't. I have no idea who thought this would be a great way to proceed, but they were dead wrong. I know that a lot of people have been upset about how useless Image Playground is (and this is completely true), but the general AI is just worse. Let's face it: Apple just completely fucked up their "Intelligence" rollout and they have to fix it post-haste.
