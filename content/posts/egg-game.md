# A blast from the past

I was cleaning out some more things today and I found this gem. It's from the early 80s and I must have spent countless hours with my brother and even my parents playing this little game.

I looked online and they actually sell for quite a bit of money so I may actually end up selling it. I honestly have no intention of ever playing it again, but it was nice to see it again and yes, it does work.
