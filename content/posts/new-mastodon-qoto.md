# New Mastodon

I migrated from the Mastodon server emacs.ch to qoto.org.

I still love emacs.ch but qoto has some more benefits, such as a 65,535 char post limit and a few other things. That's huge. That's enormous, in fact. It's also a STEM-based instance, so there's still some interesting things going on. So my new Mastodon is @natharari@qoto.org.

Also: I really ought to update this blog more often. I don't know why I don't.
