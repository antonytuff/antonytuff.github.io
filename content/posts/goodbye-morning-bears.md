# Goodbye morning bears.

I've been posting a picture of a polar bear every single morning on Facebook since something like 2014 or 2015, without fail. And, as much as I love polar bears, I think it's time to say goodbye to this morning tradition.

I started it because I wanted to see something happy first thing in the morning before anything else. But it has long since worn out that usefulness for me. For a few years now, I've only been doing it because people expect me to do it - it's literally the only thing I tend to post on Facebook now since many, many years.

So, it's time to stop with the bears. I love the bears, I'll miss it at first, and maybe I'll post a few random ones here and there, but it will no longer be an every single morning thing for me.

Thanks for all the comments and likes, and all the messages. It's been a great polar bear of a time.

I might decide to post some on my blog at some point, but it won't be every morning (or even every month), and I'll try to find a new morning tradition to make me smile online instead of this.
