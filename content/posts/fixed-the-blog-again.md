# I fixed the blog again
I had this weird setup with github using two repos - one public and one private. I still don't understand how I set it up this way but I was following instructions from a tutorial which had it set up like that.

When I tried to remove the setup, it of course borked everything up. I gave up for a bit in frustration because it wasn't a priority for me and I knew I'd have to sit down and re-up everything and set everything up from scratch to a new repo.

I finally did it, and it works. Couldn't be happier about it.
