# About Me

Lots to say, but I'm not going to do that. Not on one page.

However, I can give a brief summary:

I was born in 1970, so I'm now considered old.

I used to be a professional photographer in Washington DC and other places for many years.

I love to work and play with computers and I have been doing so since around 1981 on an Apple ][.

I've moved around more times than some bedouins. I've lived in five countries, 9 states, and visited plenty more.

I love classical music as well as classic rock, and many things in between.

I also used to write for a living.

I love Emacs. I not only organize everything in it with org-mode, but I also email from it and read the news.

This list may be updated in the future.

If you want to know more, just ask.
