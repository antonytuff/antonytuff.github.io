But Facebook and Instagram keep bugging me for my attention. Notification after notification come up on my iPad and iPhone telling me that \u0026ldquo;Person\u0026rdquo; reacted to a post you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet commented on. Every day, dozens of them at some times.\nNow, I know that I can turn off notifications, but I find it interesting not to. Of course, I turned off the chime for them, but I still see the pop-up reminding me that I haven\u0026rsquo;t been there in a long time.\nThe one site which doesn\u0026rsquo;t do it is Twitter. Why? Because I completely deleted my account there a long while ago.\nI feel like I\u0026rsquo;m back in the 90s with the little Tamagotchi pet bugging me to feed it and pet it every 30 minutes or less (a friend of mine bought one for me as a gift at the time). It\u0026rsquo;s cute at first, but it becomes annoying after a while. I eventually let it die.\nThe only reason I still keep Facebook around is because of my contacts there. I\u0026rsquo;ve explained myself to them why I\u0026rsquo;m not on social media anymore, but they all still use it. Somebody ought to make a site where you can keep your contacts, but eliminate all of the rest of it.\n","date":"20 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/social-media-annoyances/","section":"Posts","summary":"Facebook is trying to get my attention # I haven\u0026rsquo;t been on social media in years.","title":"Social Media Annoyances"},{"content":" Time to Get Shit Done(tm) # It\u0026rsquo;s time for an early spring cleaning.\nI know, it\u0026rsquo;s only February, but I have to Get Shit Done(tm)\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to try Trademarking that at some point. \u0026ldquo;Getting Things Done\u0026rdquo; is too lackadaisical to mean that you\u0026rsquo;re getting serious, in my opinion - with all due respect to David Allen. \u0026ldquo;Things\u0026rdquo; just doesn\u0026rsquo;t convey the necessity of some tasks which have to get done for me in my life at this point.\nWhen you get old, you become the inverse of yourself # I used to go to sleep past dawn. Literally. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we all have, but I used to do it with an insane regularity which made other people wince when they heard about my lifestyle. And now, it\u0026rsquo;s the reverse. I like waking up early. I like waking up before the sun rises. I relish the quiet time in the wee hours of the morning when barely anyone is walking about outside. It\u0026rsquo;s the same feeling I got while staying up extremely late all through the night. Only now, I wake up and don\u0026rsquo;t feel like most of the day has gone past and that I have to rush to do anything at all in the world outside. It\u0026rsquo;s a calming feeling.\nCleaning out Emails # Since I was one of the first people to be invited to the beta test of Gmail back in 2001 or 2002 (I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t remember, it was so long ago), I have emails which date back from that time. I regularly delete things, but I still have over 103,000 messages, which is too many. Frankly, what am I going to do with a \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Houzz!\u0026rdquo; email from 2005? Why would I honestly need that? It\u0026rsquo;s nice to know that I\u0026rsquo;ve been a member of certain sites from paleolithic times, back when WiFi wasn\u0026rsquo;t even a thing, but is it honestly necessary to store that forever? I think not. So, part of the spring cleaning is for files. It gets me motivated to delete things in my real life when I start deleting swathes of useless crap in my digital life. And I\u0026rsquo;m glad that I\u0026rsquo;ve been deleting useless stuff all of these years since I\u0026rsquo;d think that number would probably be closer to 1,000,000 Emails or more if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t.\nMy every day goal since many years is Inbox Zero, which I\u0026rsquo;ve held up pretty well to be a standard for myself over the years. Emacs has, naturally helped with this. I suppose I could use Apple Mail to do it now, as it has timed reminders on emails, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet looked up how to utilize this function without leaving the email in my inbox, which I refuse to do. I\u0026rsquo;m quite certain that it\u0026rsquo;s fairly simple to do however, but I like how I can reference archived emails in Emacs to read later or get back to directly to my inbox.org file.\nUpdate # I\u0026rsquo;ve cleaned out a ton of stuff from my emails, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be ongoing for a while. Also: I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to sync org-agenda with my Nextcloud instance.

Again. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find inspiration to write when the world has just gone to shit since such a very long time. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much made my feelings on a host of subjects known for decades. I hate being repetitive. I loathe listening to repetition, and I revile having to sound like a parrot.\nWIth that said, I\u0026rsquo;ve recently felt the need to start writing and blogging again. I have no idea how long this will last. Maybe one post - maybe more. The one thing that I can say is that this may indeed turn out to be the most interesting year of my life so far. And with 2020 and 2022 in hindsight, that\u0026rsquo;s saying quite a lot.\nBlogs aren\u0026rsquo;t what they used to be # Back in the day (the dark ages), I used to have a very popular politics blog at the time. It\u0026rsquo;s long gone now, but it used to be a thing. I eventually burned out on it and stopped altogether (again, having failed to stop repeating myself). However, it seems like blogs became more and more of a niche thing for many years with the rising popularity of social media apps.\nNow, howeer, they seem to maybe be coming back, with the public souring more and more on social media as a whole. There are many reasons to want Twitter and even Facebook to burn and die a horrid death, but perhaps bringing some sanity back into the discourse through longform posts is one of the best.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t posted anything on the Gaza war # I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few times, and actually wrote about 20 pages worth of posts on the subject, but I kept getting disheartened and stopped before ever publishing my thoughts on the matter. I feel perhaps that, for now, it\u0026rsquo;s for the best. Though, I may have something to say about it in the future. But if you know me, you probably already know my positions anyway.\nThe U.S. Elections # I\u0026rsquo;ve made myself fairly clear on where I stand here as well. If you\u0026rsquo;re voting for anyone except for Biden at this point, you\u0026rsquo;re voting to put a dictator in power and I want to have nothing to do with you.\nRelevant link: # https://www.youtube.com/@bulwarkmedia/videos\nThe War in Ukraine # Again: My position is incredibly lucid and clear on this point. Ukraine has to win. What is there more to say? The Republican party is a party which not only supports having a dictator in the U.S. but also supports dictators abroad.\nRelevant link: # https://www.youtube.com/@JakeBroe/videos\nElon Musk # Elon Musk is the biggest liar in tech, and I\u0026rsquo;ve known this for many years. Apparently, this comes somewhat as a surprise to many people. This only demonstrates yet another state of affairs, the thought of which brings further depression. How anyone could fall of his incessant lies and bullshit for so long is beyond me. The man has been a snake oil salesman since his entire career. All of his claims in tech have been debunked. People like to point to SpaceX - which he honestly has nothing to do with in working terms - and Tesla - which he did not start or invent. It\u0026rsquo;s thoroughly depressing that some of us have been saying this for so many years, and no one has been listening until recently. And they still don\u0026rsquo;t listen because even many in the press still think he\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;genius\u0026rdquo; of some kind.\nHe isn\u0026rsquo;t, and he never has been.\nRelevant links: # https://www.youtube.com/@commonsenseskeptic/videos https://www.youtube.com/@Thunderf00t/videos (he is very repetitive in his videos but he\u0026rsquo;s never been wrong about scams.

The assumption - in all media, by the way - is that Trump would be able to pardon himself if he became the President.\nDo people actually hear themselves saying this? Do people understand what they are saying? Have all of our history and social studies classes taught the entire population literally nothing about this concept?\nIt is astounding to me that nobody is countering this. Not even on MSNBC, where liberal and anti-Trump rhetoric resides (thankfully). Everyone apparently is just comfortable with the idea that if he becomes the President, he could just do that - that they might not like it, but that is \u0026ldquo;the law\u0026rdquo;.\nHow can anyone believe this utter bullshit? How can anyone believe that this is \u0026ldquo;the law\u0026rdquo;?\nThere are no kings in America. The Founding Fathers made it clear that a king was something which they utterly rejected. George Washington was quite bloody clear on this point when he became the first President of the United States.\nA President who can pardon himself can literally do anything. Even some autocrats sometimes have to pretend to have limits. But a President who can pardon himself doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to pretend. He can literally round up 10,000,000 Americans and gun them down and the law could not touch him. He could genocide any racial, ethnic, or otherwise group in the USA, and the law could not touch him. He could literally behead people live on TV, and the law could not touch him. He would be above the Constitution, and above any justice whatsoever.\nHe would be above Congress, and above the Supreme Court.\nFor a Presidential candidate to even entertain the possibility of a self-pardon should be tantamount to treason.\nIs this really an acceptable position to have for any President?\nNot only that, but it would mean that every President in history, and every future President was, is, and will, be above the law. Do you think that sounds like the United States of America? Do you think that fits the ideals of a democracy, or even the barest framework of a republic?\nThis should not be something which people just assume is the case. This should be such a huge and obvious blasphemy (and I don\u0026rsquo;t use that word lightly) against the very ideals and foundation of the republic. It is anathema to our entire existence as a nation - historically and in the present day. One would hope that this would hold in the future as well.\nI implore everyone - everyone - to counter this assumption every time it is brought up. This is not acceptable. It is not something which should ever be allowed. It is not American in any sense whatsoever. I don\u0026rsquo;t care who says anything to the contrary, they are wrong.\nTrump cannot simply pardon himself, nor should we ever allow it to happen.\n","date":"29 October 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/there-are-no-kings-in-rome/","section":"Posts","summary":"There Are No Kings in Rome # I have been utterly aghast at the discourse in the media over the last two years in regards to Trump.","title":"There Are No Kings in Rome"},{"content":"","date":"27 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/chatgpt/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Chatgpt"},{"content":" ChatGPT Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons # As a fun little experiment last night, I had ChatGPT write out a little Dungeons and Dragons adventure. From what I learned: You can get ChatGPT to be really specific and detailed. There are a few tricks which my repeated attempts have taught me:\nYou have to be really specific and detailed in your query. You can make it a very long sentence. I\u0026rsquo;ll post mine below so that you can see. It probably could have gone better but it was about 30 minutes before I went to sleep so I was fairly tired.\nYou can ask it questions based on previous queries so it knows what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about. This means that if the output is too long, break it down into a sort of outline. Then ask questions about each sub-item. It will know what you\u0026rsquo;re referring to.\nEvery time it generates something, it will be slightly or even hugely different - it depends what you\u0026rsquo;re asking it to do. So if the first attempt doesn\u0026rsquo;t succeed, try again. Even trying again with the same query will have a different output.\nI wanted this to be a little adventure about my friend Josh and I from our heyday back in the mid-80s. The Trident of Fish Command is a continual joke with us since almost 40 years as it was one of the prizes in a hoard of an adventure which sent us roaring into laughter. We deemed this to be one of the most useless magical items in D\u0026amp;D at the time. We still joke about it today fairly regularly to denote something utterly useless. (You may have had to be there to get the entirety of the joke**\nMy Query: Write a detailed Dungeons and Dragons adventure. It must contain the following: Joshus Kolchinus is a Dwarven Cleric who is also a librarian. His friend, Slartibart, is a surly old mage who cackles at the misfortunes of his enemies. They start in a tavern and have at least five paragraphs of conversation of previous adventures together. Detail the tavern, the cost of the beer and rooms, and what they are equipped with as well. Then they hear of a dungeon not far away from a conversation next to them. Detail the surrounding area outside of the dungeon with at least 3 encounters. Detail all of the encounters with monsters as well as their treasure. Each encouter rewards includes gold, silver, jewels, items, and magical items. Detail all of that. Then, they enter the Dungeon. The dungeon has at least 30 rooms and at least 12 encounters with random monsters. Detail all of the monsters. They also have treasure which can include gold, silver, copper, electrum, magical items and jewels. Detail each treasure hoard. The dungeon also has several traps, which you need to detail as well, and it also has 3 puzzles, which also need to be detailed. At the end of the dungeon is a vast cavern with a sea serpent, which needs to have detailed statistics as well, and a vast treasure hoard containing gold, silver, electrum, copper, jewels, art, and magical items. All of this has to be detailed. It also contains a trident of fish command as the main prize which also needs details. I need the statistics of each monster in each encounter as well as the statistics of each item found in the dungeon. I also need the details of the puzzles and traps. List all of the monster details at the end of the adventure. And write out a text map of the surrounding area outside and the dungeon inside.\nResult:\nTitle: The Quest for the Trident of Fish Command\nJoshus Kolchinus, a Dwarven Cleric, and his friend, Slartibart, a surly old mage, sit at a wooden table in the smoky, dimly lit tavern. The tavern is packed with travelers, adventurers, and locals all in search of a drink and a story. Joshus and Slartibart order two frothy mugs of ale and begin recounting their past adventures together over a plate of roasted boar.\nAs they reminisce, they overhear a group of adventurers at the next table mentioning a nearby dungeon rumored to be filled with treasure. The two friends perk up their ears and make their way over to listen in on the conversation. After a few moments of eavesdropping, they learn that the dungeon is located just a few miles west of the tavern, near a dense forest. Excited by the prospect of treasure, Joshus and Slartibart head to the bar to pay for their ale and rooms.\nThe cost of a mug of ale is 1 silver piece, and the cost of a room for the night is 5 gold pieces. The rooms are equipped with a sturdy bed, a wooden chest for storing personal belongings, and a small table and chair for writing. Joshus and Slartibart each purchase a room for the night.\nAs they prepare to set out to the dungeon the next morning, they encounter three different obstacles on the way:\nA group of goblins attempting to rob travelers on the road. The goblins are armed with rusty swords and makeshift shields. The party defeats the goblins and finds a small treasure hoard containing 75 silver pieces and a Potion of Healing.\nA bridge over a rushing river has collapsed, forcing the party to either wade through the icy water or find another way across. They eventually find a fallen tree that can be used as a makeshift bridge.\nA group of wolves block the path, snarling and baring their teeth. The party successfully scares off the wolves with a well-timed Thunderwave spell from Slartibart. They find a small treasure hoard containing 50 silver pieces and a Ring of Animal Friendship.\nThe dungeon has 35 rooms, and the party encounters 12 different types of monsters. Here are the details of the encounters, along with the treasure found:\nA group of skeletons guarding a small room. The skeletons wield rusty swords and shields. The treasure hoard contains 100 copper pieces and a Potion of Water Breathing.\nA mimic disguised as a treasure chest. The mimic lashes out at the party with its sticky tentacles. The treasure hoard contains 300 gold pieces and a Wand of Magic Missiles.\nA group of orcs lounging in a common room. The orcs are armed with battleaxes and shields. The treasure hoard contains 200 gold pieces and a Scroll of Protection from Energy.\nA pack of giant spiders lurking in a web-filled corridor. The spiders pounce on the party with their venomous fangs. The treasure hoard contains 150 silver pieces and a Bag of Holding.\nA swarm of rats in a kitchen. The rats scurry and squeak as they attack the party. The treasure hoard contains 75 copper pieces and a Ring of Jumping.\nA group of lizardfolk guards defending a key to a locked door. The lizardfolk use their sharp claws to attack. The treasure hoard contains 500 silver pieces and a Staff of Frost.\nA room filled with animated furniture, including a chair, a table, and a chandelier. The furniture comes to life and attacks the party. The treasure hoard contains 350 gold pieces and a Wand of Fireballs.\nA pit with a gelatinous cube lurking inside. The cube engulfs the party members, attempting to digest them. The treasure hoard contains 100 electrum pieces and a Cloak of Elvenkind.\nA group of kobolds defending their treasure hoard. The kobolds use cunning traps and ambush tactics to attack the party. The treasure hoard contains 300 copper pieces and a Ring of Shielding.\nA dark, damp room with a patch of mold growing on the wall. The mold releases a cloud of poisonous spores. The treasure hoard contains 250 silver pieces and a Potion of Invisibility.\nA group of ghouls, reanimated corpses with sharp claws and teeth. The ghouls lunge at the party, attempting to paralyze them. The treasure hoard contains 400 gold pieces and a Staff of Healing.\nA beholder, a floating eyeball monster with multiple eye stalks. The beholder attacks the party with its disintegration ray and telekinetic ray. The treasure hoard contains 1000 gold pieces and a Wand of Polymorph.\nAlong the way, the party also encounters several traps and puzzles:\nA pressure plate in the floor of a narrow hallway triggers a trap that unleashes a hail of poisoned darts. The party must either find a way around the plate or disarm the trap.\nA riddle inscribed on a stone tablet blocks the way to one of the rooms. The party must decipher the riddle to proceed.\nA room filled with mirrors and illusions. The party must use keen observation to identify the correct path through the maze of mirrors.\nAt the end of the dungeon, the party enters a vast cavern with a massive sea serpent coiled in the center. The serpent lashes out at the party with its sharp teeth and tail. Here are the sea serpent\u0026rsquo;s statistics:\nSea Serpent Type: Huge Beast Armor Class: 18 Hit Points: 250 Speed: 40 ft., swim 80 ft.

It took a lot of learning back then.\nBut then the ugly head of filthy lucre reared its head and decided that what was best was to dumb it down, force a single choice upon users, and we know the rest of the story.\nThe fact is: Most people have simply never learned how to \u0026ldquo;use\u0026rdquo; the internet. They know a few sites such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc\u0026hellip; but that\u0026rsquo;s all they ever learned. And when you sign up to those sites, you\u0026rsquo;re not given any choices; they are all made for you. What used to take about 10-60 minutes of figuring out now takes about 3 clicks. Hell, it\u0026rsquo;s been 30 years and they still don\u0026rsquo;t know how to pick a secure password. They never \u0026ldquo;picked\u0026rdquo; Gmail either. They just went to gmail, typed in a name with a stupid number, and that was it. The same goes for Twitter and Facebook and the rest.\nNot only that: It would populate your entire friend list with your contacts. You don\u0026rsquo;t even have to start from 0. And it would do so automatically just by clicking \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; when asked about it.\nWhenever I help people with \u0026ldquo;computers\u0026rdquo; (never a specific, just \u0026ldquo;computers\u0026rdquo; in general), they\u0026rsquo;re still asking me the same basic questions they should have learned 25 years ago. They\u0026rsquo;ve never learned. Ever.\nSo, asking them to pick a Mastodon instance? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s as easy as choosing an email server. But they never did that to begin with. They don\u0026rsquo;t even understand the concept of it. They use \u0026ldquo;computers\u0026rdquo; ever day (in the form of a phone for many) but they still have no idea what they\u0026rsquo;re actually doing.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not advocating that we teach everyone how to program, but basic computer literacy would be good.\nBut then the question: Whom, exactly, is \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo;? Well, that would have to be the local education system. And while great strides have been made, it\u0026rsquo;s not enough. People have been learning \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; computers for a decade and a half in class now, but I still don\u0026rsquo;t see the rewards of it online. Sure, more people are in tech now, but what exactly has been the overall experience for most?

Replace \u0026ldquo;Republican\u0026rdquo; with any other name, and you would get a declaration that this party, this movement, this organization is a political terrorist organization.\nFor some reason, Americans have their heads stuck up their collective asses when it comes to these things. The left is trying to rationalize some sort of imbecilic need for \u0026ldquo;decorum\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard countless talking heads recount countless times how we just don\u0026rsquo;t charge our former Presidents with a crime because it is not our \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo;.\nYou know what else isn\u0026rsquo;t in our tradition? Trying to overthrow the government with a literal violent coup. That\u0026rsquo;s never happened before either.\nLet me explain to people about tradition: We can create tradition. Have you ever heard of the Nuremberg trials? Charging people for Genocide was literally never done before in modern legal history (let alone ancient history). This was a first. And there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why it\u0026rsquo;s a legal framework now: because we invented it to deal with a new situation. We didn\u0026rsquo;t just throw our hands up and say that we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo; of charging people with crimes against humanity. We created the conditions in which we could do that as a response to a new situation.\nWhen I was young, we all idolized Lincoln. Do you think that Lincoln had a framework for fighting a civil war? Do you think that he had a framework for freeing the slaves? No. But it seems that Americans, back then, were absolutely willing to respond to situations by creating new frameworks and not necessarily invoking tradition as an excuse to do nothing.\nI suggest that we take a page out of that book. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s true: We don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;tradition\u0026rdquo; of charging ex-Presidents with crimes, but we are faced with the situation for the first time in our country\u0026rsquo;s history wherein we need to charge him with crimes - egregious crimes. And we need to create a framework in which we don\u0026rsquo;t just shrug it off because it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;not traditional\u0026rdquo;, buck up, and do it. And if his followers decide to react with violence, then we deal with them as well.\n","date":"12 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/a-terrorist-party/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Republicans are a terrorist party.","title":"A Terrorist Party"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/law/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Law"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/law/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Law"},{"content":" Don\u0026rsquo;t celebrate yet. # With the recent FBI raid on Trump\u0026rsquo;s home, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some people celebrating as if it\u0026rsquo;s all coming to a head. I think it\u0026rsquo;s worth stepping back for a moment to realize that we should be unconvinced of any progress to put Trump in jail until such time as he\u0026rsquo;s actually in jail.\nThe fact is that I cannot, for the life of me, see Trump ever going to jail. There\u0026rsquo;s no one I wish more in America to be in jail since before he was first elected, but I think they\u0026rsquo;ll never do it.

Plus, with Plain Org, I can keep viewing my Skyrim notes on my iPad or iPhone anytime I want (as well as everything else). It\u0026rsquo;s honestly fantastic.\nThat and with me running mu4e in emacs for email, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to just rely on my iPhone or iPad to view emails in fastmail. I can just go right to emacs and check out my emails while I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying Skyrim.\n","date":"16 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/skyrim-and-emacs/","section":"Posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely loving my MacBook Pro M1 Max # What amazes me is how fast it is.","title":"Skyrim and Emacs"},{"content":" xbar is really cool. # Recently, I found a very, very useful app for the Mac called xbar. It\u0026rsquo;s free and incredibly powerful and community-driven. Here is the link: xbar.\nWhat it does is it puts a litle thing in your menu bar up top where you can load an enormous amount of plugins. These are written by all sorts of other people and fully open source. You have to figure out a little bit of code, like where your own directories are etc\u0026hellip; but you can install these plugins, edit them to fit your needs (the code is fully public so there won\u0026rsquo;t be any hacking of your system), and make it do whatever you want it to do. If you know Perl or Python or just shell scripting, you can even write your own.\nIt basically makes the menu bar accessible to whatever kind of scripting you need and want at a moment\u0026rsquo;s glance. There is a public repo built in with many different kinds of plugins or, as I\u0026rsquo;ve said, you can just write your own to do anything from show you different statuses of your machine, running a command, checking on an email count of unread messages in emacs/mu4e, playing with itunes controls, logging into different servers at the click of a button, and more. Anything that your shell can run, it can run in the menu bar for you.\nIt can even run weather checking statuses for you if you want. The list is huge.\nI highly recommend checking it out.\n","date":"12 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/xbar/","section":"Posts","summary":"xbar is really cool.","title":"xbar"},{"content":" Getting up and walking around and doing things is good for you. # I bought an Apple Watch several months ago. It\u0026rsquo;s my first smart watch and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier about it.\nI did my research. I didn\u0026rsquo;t just buy it, and obviously I didn\u0026rsquo;t jump onto the bandwagon immediately after they first started coming out. It took years. I thought that it would be sort of useless for me to get one. The fact is that this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve been wearing a watch since around 1996. Back then, I went to Santa Cruz to be with my girlfriend for the summer and she forcibly removed my watch because I was obsessive about checking the time, all the time, and following a certain agenda in my head. Since then, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t worn a watch - until now. 2022.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a very long time.\nLike most people, I just checked my phone for the time. I thought, I didn\u0026rsquo;t need a watch after all.\nBut then I started wanting to work out and the idea hit me that to encourage myself and plan accordingly, a watch would help me. It would track my daily exercise (which it does very well), as well as monitor my sleep patterns. You see, I\u0026rsquo;ve been suffering for a bit of insomnia in the last year or so. This was unusual in the fact that I was always the guy who could fall asleep at the drop of a hat, anywhere, anytime. So I wanted to see what was up with my sleeping cycles as well.\nSo I got the watch after carefully researching my options (I really took months here). I went researching sleep apps as well (I use Sleep Cycle). I subscribed for a year and it really was worth it. I\u0026rsquo;ve been tracking my sleep patterns every night. I went researching which app was best for this and found a guy online who is an actual sleep scientist in a lab who tests all of these apps and then gave his recommendation for the best one which mimics the equipment they use in an actual scientific lab for sleep research. He recommended Sleep Cycle, so I chose that.\nBut the one thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise about my watch was this: It reminds me every hour to get up and walk around for a minute. And, as it turns out, that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. You see, I get drawn into the screen like nothing else. I can sit there without moving for five or six hours and not even realize that the time has gone by. With my watch on, it not only dings a reminder, it taps my wrist - a bit hard to ignore that. Get up and walk around for a minute.\nSo, I\u0026rsquo;ve started doing that. And then I started doing a bit more than that. With more task management about doing things instead of just doing things on the computer, I\u0026rsquo;ve started to get up intermittently to do things around the house. Cleaning up, putting things away, vacuuming, etc\u0026hellip;.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve found is that I actually am more productive on the computer with these breaks in between. What I\u0026rsquo;ve realised is that I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it all wrong. That time mostly spent where I\u0026rsquo;d be doing things, I\u0026rsquo;ve been drawn into just staring at pages and pages without really absorbing anything. Part of it is social media or reading the news which, frankly, I can do in very short bursts now.\nI know everyone has been told this, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found it to actually be true. For some reason, when I look at my daily log (which I\u0026rsquo;ve started keeping in a journal in Emacs), it has been getting more and more full of actual computer tasks as well as daily tasks now that I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking breaks to do things around the house. So it\u0026rsquo;s not just me imagining it since I have an actual log of everything I do every day.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t feel as if I\u0026rsquo;m missing out on anything at all and, as a plus, my place is starting to get much nicer to live in.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.\n","date":"9 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/getting-up/","section":"Posts","summary":"Getting up and walking around and doing things is good for you.","title":"Getting Up"},{"content":"","date":"9 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/health/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Health"},{"content":"","date":"9 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/smart-watch/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Smart Watch"},{"content":" I really like Dracula Theme for Emacs. # I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying the Dracula Theme for about a week or so and I really enjoy it.

In fact, I know of non-coders who have learned Emacs just to be able to use org-mode. And learning Emacs is not for the faint of heart. But org-mode is that powerful that it entices people towards it who would never normally touch code with a ten foot pole.\nHowever, I’ve found that it has one failing: It has limited mobile capabilities.\nNow, I know that people will point to Beorg and other apps (I use the excellent Plain Org myself), but you can’t really edit things so easily on the fly, and you can’t build your org-mode agenda from those files in any way that I can see. It’s just a bit of a hassle.\nEnter Apple Reminders. Better than Apple Calender for many things, I use Apple Reminders for everything non-computer/project related. Meaning: Chores, shopping lists, repeating tasks around the house or in the real world. I save org for anything that requires me to be at the computer. That way, I can carry my tasks around with me related to the real world, and save the excellent project management system of org-mode for my computer when it’s fully available.\nI find myself saving links to Plain Org all the time (I have an inbox.org and a refile system which works wonders) and I can open those files up on my phone or iPad with no problems whatsoever. But for the tasks themselves, I use Apple Reminders.\nApple Reminders is getting better and better every year. They now have smart tags which work in conjunction with Apple Notes (which I also use for a few non-computer things). This way, you can build smart lists, such as Weekly Chores, Daily Chores, Bi-Monthly Chores, etc…all related to the real world for me and not the computer one. You can set geotag location things to pop up when you’re in an area (if you bother to set that up, which I have) so that you won’t forget to do or buy something when you’re there. It also looks very… “Apple”. Meaning: Minimalist, colourful, simple and easy. In fact I’ve taken out many of my repeating tasks and reminders from Apple’s Calendar (also very good), and put them into Reminders in my smart lists.\nThis way, I’m starting an entirely easy to manage set of two systems which could not be easier to decide upon: Is it related to my computer and something online? Then it goes into org-mode. If not, it goes into Apple Reminders.\nIt also allows me to minimalise the amounts of data I have in org-mode at any given time and concentrate fairly large plans and writing just in that system alone, so that I don’t clutter up my nicely managed Reminders system.\n","date":"5 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/reminders-vs-org-agenda/","section":"Posts","summary":"I’ve decided a few things about Org Mode.","title":"Apple Reminders vs. Org Agenda"},{"content":"","date":"5 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/org-mode/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Org-Mode"},{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;ve added an About page. # I\u0026rsquo;ve just added an \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page on the top menu.\nI know I haven\u0026rsquo;t written anything here yet of value, but it will come.
